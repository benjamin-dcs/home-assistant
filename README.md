In this repository I provide Automations, Scripts and other files for Home Assistant.

The code in this repo is often a slightly modified (and untested) version of my personal version. In case of any issues, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/benjamin-dcs/home-assistant/issues)

## [Birthday Notifier](automations/birthday_notifier.yaml)
Uses a Home Assistant calender to send several notifications for someone's birthday. Calendar events are expected to be in one of the following two formats:
- \<Name\>
- \<Name\> (YYYY)

When using the second format, the age is calculated and included in the notification. 
- Sends a notification at 12:00 **_2 days_** prior to the birthday
- Sends a notification at 12:00 **_1 day_** prior to the birthday
- Sends a notification **_every hour_**, starting at day of birth until the notification is _Marked as done_ (You have send a celebration message to the person ðŸŽ‰).

**Requirements:**
- Switch Helper: input_boolean.birthday_celebration_sent

**Dependencies:**
- Uses the [`Notify Me`](scripts/notify_me.yaml) Script to send the notifications
- Uses the [`Notification Action Handler`](automations/notification_action_handler.yaml) Automation to handle the _'Mark as done'_ action

## [Notification Action Handler](automations/notification_action_handler.yaml)
Generic Automation to handle all my [Actionable Notifications](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/actionable-notifications/).

# [Scripts](scripts)
## [Notify Me](scripts/notify_me.yaml)

## [Get ChatGPT Response](scripts/get_chatgpt_response.yaml)
Provides a user friendly (visual editor) interface to get a ChatGPT response.

**Features:**
- Templatable prompt field
- Selector for language
- Templatable instruction field
- Selector for ChatGPT model. The model(s) should be exactly the same as your OpenAI Conversation entity. For example model `gpt_4o_mini` uses `conversation.gpt_4o_mini` as conversation agent.

## [Set Input Text with ChatGPT](scripts/set_input_text_with_chatgpt.yaml)
In the majority of my use-cases for a ChatGPT response, I store the result in a Text-Helper. I then use this Text-Helper as the source for my Automation/Script when it runs. At the end of the Automation/Script, I run this `Set Input Text with ChatGPT`-script to renew the Text-Helper. This has two advantages:
- No extra wait-time from ChatGPT before I need the response. For example, in my doorbell automation I want the notifcation to be send as quickly as possible.
- When ChatGPT isn't responding for whatever reason, my automation/script will still continue to run because the text is already stored.

**Features:**
- Templatable prompt field
- Selector for language
- Templatable instruction field
- Selector for ChatGPT model.
- Entity-Selector
- Remove First And Last Quotes Switch. For some prompts, ChatGPT's response is quoted. This option removes the first and last quote from the response.
