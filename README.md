In this repository I provide Automations, Scripts and other files for Home Assistant.

# [Automations ðŸ”—](https://github.com/benjamin-dcs/home-assistant/blob/main/automations/)
## [Birthday Notifier ðŸ”—](https://github.com/benjamin-dcs/home-assistant/blob/main/automations/birthday_notifier.yaml)
Uses a Home Assistant calender to send several notifications for someone's birthday. Calendar events are expected to be in one of the following two formats:
- \<Name\>
- \<Name\> (YYYY)

When using the second format, the age is calculated and included in the notification. 
- Sends a notification at 12:00 **_2 days_** prior to the birthday
- Sends a notification at 12:00 **_1 day_** prior to the birthday
- Sends a notification **_every hour_**, starting at day of birth until the notification is _Marked as done_ (You have send a celebration message to the person ðŸŽ‰).

**Dependencies:
- Uses the [`Notify Me`](https://github.com/benjamin-dcs/home-assistant/blob/main/scripts/notify_me.yaml) Script to handle the _'Mark as done'_ action
- Uses the [`Notification Action Handler`](https://github.com/benjamin-dcs/home-assistant/blob/main/automations/notification_action_handler.yaml) Automation to handle the _'Mark as done'_ action
