<b>In this repository I provide Automations, Scripts and other files for Home Assistant.</b>

### Notes
- The code in this repo is often a slightly modified (and untested) version of my personal version. In case of any issues, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/benjamin-dcs/home-assistant/issues)
- As I am Dutch, some files will contain Dutch text. My guess is that most of you should be able to find your way to Google Translate ;)

# [Automations](automations)
### [Birthday Notifier](automations/birthday_notifier.yaml)
Uses a Home Assistant calender to send several notifications for someone's birthday. For Calendar events ending with `(YYYY)` (including the brackets) the age is calculated and added to the notification.

**Features:**
- Sends a notification at 12:00 **_2 days_** prior to the birthday
- Sends a notification at 12:00 **_1 day_** prior to the birthday
- Sends a notification **_every hour_**, starting at day of birth until the notification is _Marked as done_ (You have send a celebration message to the person ðŸŽ‰).

**Requirements:**
- Switch Helper: input_boolean.birthday_celebration_sent

**Dependencies:**
- Uses the [`Notify Me`](scripts/notify_me.yaml) Script to send the notifications
- Uses the [`Notification Action Handler`](automations/notification_action_handler.yaml) Automation to handle the _'Mark as done'_ action

### [Notification Action Handler](automations/notification_action_handler.yaml)
Generic Automation to handle all my [Actionable Notifications](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/actionable-notifications/).

### [Purge Entities](automations/purge_entities.yaml)
Simple automation to purge entites after 1, 3 or 7 days.

**Tip!** Use a tool like [DbStats](https://github.com/jehy/hass-addons/tree/master/dbstats) to analyse your Home Assistant Database. Use the automation for entities that use a lot of disc-space to keep your database as small as possible.

# [Scripts](scripts)
### [Notify Me](scripts/notify_me.yaml)
Provides a user friendly (visual editor) interface to send a notification to one or multiple notification providers, including Home Assistant Persistent Notifications.

**Features:**
- (Multi-)Selector for Notification Service(s)
- Templatable message field
- Templatable title field
- Data object
- Templatable url field

### [Get ChatGPT Response](scripts/get_chatgpt_response.yaml)
Provides a user friendly (visual editor) interface to get a ChatGPT response.

**Features:**
- Templatable prompt field
- Selector for language
- Templatable instruction field
- Selector for ChatGPT model. The model(s) should be exactly the same as your OpenAI Conversation entity. For example model `gpt_4o_mini` uses `conversation.gpt_4o_mini` as conversation agent.

### [Set Input Text with ChatGPT](scripts/set_input_text_with_chatgpt.yaml)
In the majority of my use-cases for a ChatGPT response, I store the result in a Text-Helper. I then use this Text-Helper as the source for my Automation/Script when it runs. At the end of the Automation/Script, I run this `Set Input Text with ChatGPT`-script to renew the Text-Helper. This has two advantages:
- No extra wait-time from ChatGPT before I need the response. For example, in my doorbell automation I want the notifcation to be send as quickly as possible.
- When ChatGPT isn't responding for whatever reason, my automation/script will still continue to run because the text is already stored.

**Features:**
- Templatable prompt field
- Selector for language
- Templatable instruction field
- Selector for ChatGPT model.
- Entity-Selector
- Remove First And Last Quotes Switch. For some prompts, ChatGPT's response is quoted. This option removes the first and last quote from the response.

### [Compact Energy Card](dashboard/compact_energy_card.yaml)
Probably requires some tweaking of the `grid-template-columns` percentages in order to get right on your own dashboard/screen
